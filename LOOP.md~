***CRITICAL*** Read the todo list, do the first item on the checklist. Only do a single item.
***CRITICAL*** When you are done with an item, validate your work and fix any errors, then edit the checklist to check the item off the list, and then stop.
***CRITICAL*** Do not ask if you should do it or how you should do it, just do it.
***CRITICAL*** After each step, if you think it requires more work then add more todo items in an appropriate location in the todo list
***CRITICAL*** When you do research, write your findings into a new file in the 'research' subdirectory and make a reference to it in the todo list when checking the item off the list
***CRITICAL*** After checking off an item, write what you did to a git commit message in the file .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
***CRITICAL*** If you are done with every item in the checklist, create an empty file in the root directory named .done
***CRITICAL*** Append to CHANGELOG.md after you have checked off a task
***CRITICAL*** If there are multiple subtasks under a parent task, only do the first one.
